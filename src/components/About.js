    <p>This is a pretty neat app and you should totally like it. It's build on react, and I have build this for some Udemy course.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the tools I used:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="">React</a> - This was the JS framework used.</li>
      <li><a href="">Open Weather Map</a> - I used Open Weather Map to search for weather data by city name.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

export default About;
